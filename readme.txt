This is a repository of simple Python projects I've worked on in my free time, mostly to develop and sharpen data analysis skills. 

Boiler_Gold_Rush - this is a game similar to minesweeper, in which a player attempts to locate a gold circle in as few guesses as possible.

alienDNA - this program reads the contents of 2 files, combining the elements into pairs to store as a list. 
            it then counts the occurences of each possible value and saves this report as a text file. sample text files are provided.

displayshifts- This program reads through a large text file containing work shifts to display the total numbers in a graphical interface.

pulsars- lab5.py combines data from two separate data files and organizes it into a horizontal bar chart to visualize the data.

salespractice - tablesummary.py retreives data from an included excel file and summarizes it to a table.

bargraphs - this program creates a bar graph to visualize the comparison of 2 numerical values.
